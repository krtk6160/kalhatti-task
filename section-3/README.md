Question 1: Why is there a lot of hype around blockchain?

I believe the main reason for the hype around blockchain was the steep rise in bitcoin prices during November and December, 2017. People started noticing an investment opportunity that could yield returns that were unheard of. People saw it as a get rich quick scheme, and suddenly everyone was talking about bitcoin. Although blockchain is much more than bitcoin, for the general population, blockchain was bitcoin and bitcoin was blockchain. This is especially true in my country, India. News channels and newspapers were sometimes using the terms 'bitcoin' and 'blockchain' interchangeably, and even when they weren't, no one was explaining how bitcoin is only one possible application out of a hundred others made possible by blockchain tech.
Secondary factors include the ridiculous rise in the number of ICOs, and people trying to solve every problem using blockchain, without understanding the limitations of the technology at this point of time.



Question 2: What got you fascinated with blockchain and why? 

The first time I ever read about blockchain tech was when I heard about bitcoin, around 2012-13, on an internet forum dedicated to hacking. I remember reading a guide about bitcoin mining, and being confused as to how coins could be mined. I tried running the mining software on my laptop, but after a couple hours of no progress and being unable to understand what it actually meant, I finally moved on to other stuff.
After that, the first time I actually tried understanding blockchain technology, was towards the end of 2016, in my first year of engineering, when bitcoin's initial rise had started. Ethereum development was also gathering pace, and I used to read articles about the potential use of blockchain tech in domains such as finance, healthcare, supplychain management, identity verification, etc.
I also started reading and trying out decentralized systems and applications (which didn't directly run on the blockchain, but used blockchain protocols), like IPFS and ZeroNet, and how they removed a single point of failure, were censorship proof, and provided anonymity.
That got me fascinated with blockchain tech, and decentralization in general.
I realized that hardly anyone in my college had any idea about blockchain tech, and it was an opportunity for me to get a head start. I finally started learning blockchain dev in 2017, doing a Hyperledger Fabric course on Coursera, and then moved to Ethereum development.

Question 3: What is the most pressing challenge in blockchain? 

I believe the most pressing challenge facing blockchain tech is security.
Although most of the security breaches stem from poor software design, user negligence and incompetence, it is the technology that suffers from the bad publicity generated due to the numerous hacks that happen every week. It has led to people being wary of investing in blockchain (mainly crypto), and a general sense of mistrust for the tech, which has hindered research and development.
Another big issue is scalability, especially true for Ethereum and BitCoin, which have suffered from high-transcation times and high transaction costs due to the massive increase in number of users.

Bonus Question 4: Thoughts PoW vs. PoS

I read a report by The World Economic Forum that the bitcoin network energy consumption was close to the power used by 700 American homes at the low end, and on average is much higher than that. That is a huge amount of power being used, and most of it is wasted, since only the first miner to solve the problem is given the rewards, and the others have to start mining again from the next block.
The Ethereum network also requires a huge amount of power to run. This is because both networks use Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, which causes huge energy waste.
PoW has also led to networks becoming increasingly centralized instead of decentralized, because the mining hardware required these days is extremely expensive, and only big corporations have the resources necessary to buy them, not to mention the high costs of electricity usage and cooling equipment required to cool the mining rigs.
Proof-Of-Stake doesn't suffer from the same problems, since the next miner doesn't have to solve a computational puzzle, but instead has to stake his money and bet on the next block. This eliminates the need for expensive mining hardware, and makes it possible for more peers to participate in the mining process.
But, PoS suffers from the 'Nothing-at-Stake' problem where a malicious miner can work on each and every chain (if a fork occurs) and have nothing to lose, and can double spend their stake.
Etheruem's proposed Casper protocol claims to have fixed this problem by punishing malicious validators by slashing their stakes.
There's also the issue that the already influential validators will get even more influential, as PoS validation rewards are typically proportionate to a validator's stake. This will lead to centralization of the mining power.
I believe we'll have to move on from PoW soon to solve the scalability and energy problems, but PoS comes with its own set of problems. Hopefully, with all the research going on currently, we'll soon find the solutions to these problems and see mass adoption of different blockchain systems and apps.
